Introduction
============

The Doctrine Inflector has static methods for inflecting text.
The features include pluralization, singularization,
converting between camelCase and under_score and capitalizing
words.

All you need to use the Inflector is the ``Doctrine\Common\Inflector\Inflector``
class.

Installation
============

You can install the Inflector with composer:

.. code-block::

    $ composer require doctrine/inflector

Here are the available methods that you can use:

Tableize
========

Converts ``ModelName`` to ``model_name``:

.. code-block:: php

    echo Inflector::tableize('ModelName'); // model_name

Classify
========

Converts ``model_name`` to ``ModelName``:

.. code-block:: php

    echo Inflector::classify('model_name'); // ModelName

Camelize
========

This method uses `Classify`_ and then converts the first character to lowercase:

.. code-block:: php

    echo Inflector::camelize('model_name'); // modelName

ucwords
=======

Takes a string and capitalizes all of the words, like PHP's built-in
ucwords function. This extends that behavior, howev
